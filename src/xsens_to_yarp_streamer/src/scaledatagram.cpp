/*! \class ScaleDatagram
	Scale information (type 0x10)
	This packet contains scaling information about the character. This information is only useful for MVN Studio, since it only applies to a mesh of a specific size. However, there may be a way to put this information to use for other meshes.

	The data sent per item is:

	4 bytes segment ID, in the range 1-30
	4 bytes x–offset of segment relative to default position
	4 bytes y–offset of segment relative to default position
	4 bytes z–offset of segment relative to default position

	9x4 bytes matrix containing the rotation and scale of the segment relative to the default
	n bytes containing a null-terminated string with the name of the segment

	Total: unknown, minimum  bytes per segment

	The coordinates use a Z-Up, right-handed coordinate system.

	The Scale packets are divided in parts, to avoid exceed the 1500 byte packet size limit. For a normal biped this results in a total of 5 packets.
	To deserialize the packets whe should follow this rules:
	- The first packet contains the null pose definition (T-pose);
	- The points will end up with a varying number per datagram with 0 segments (Points Definitation packets).
	- The last packet is the one that will end up in one datagram with 0 points.
